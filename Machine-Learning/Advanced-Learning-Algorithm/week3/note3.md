## Advice for applying machine learning
### Evaluating your model
* training set $(x^{(1)},y^{(1)})$, test set$(x_{test}^{(1)},y_{test}^{(1)})$.
* Linear regression:
  * Cost function: $J_{train}+J_{test}+J_{regularzation}$
* Classify:
  * $J_{train}$ fraction of the train set that has been misclassified.
  * $J_{test}$ fraction of the test set that has been misclassified.
