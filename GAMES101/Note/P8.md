# Shading 2 (Shading, Pipeline and Texture Mapping)
## Blinn-Phong reflection model
### Specular Term
Intensity depends on view direction
* Bright **near** mirror reflection direction
  * **Half vector:** $\bold{h} = bisector(\bold{v},\bold{l}) = \frac{\bold{v+l}}{||\bold{v+l}||}$ near normal
Specular highlight:
$$L_s =k_s(\frac{I}{r^2})max(0,\cos\alpha)^P= k_s(\frac{I}{r^2})max(0, \bold{n}\cdot\bold{h})^P$$
* $L_s$ specularly reflected light
* $k_s$ specular coefficient
* $max(0, \bold{n}\cdot\bold{l})$  energy received by the shading point isn't considered
* $max(0, \bold{n}\cdot\bold{h})$ because this is Blinn-Phong model
* Increasing p narrows the reflection lobe (8, 64...)

### Ambient Term
Shading that doesn't depend on anything
* Add **constant color** to account for disregarded illumination and fill in black shadows
* Approximate / fake!
Ambient lighting:  
$$L_a = k_a I_a$$
* $L_a$ reflected ambient light
* $k_a$ ambient coefficient

### Total color
$$L = L_a + L_d + L_s$$

## SHading frequencies
### Shade each triangle (Flat shading)
* Triangle face is flat - one normal vector

### Shade each vertex (Gouraud shading)
* Interpolate folors from vertices across trangle
* Each vertex has a normal vector

### Shade each pixel (Phong shading)
* Interpolate noramal vectors across each triangle
* Compute fullshading model at each pixel
* Not the Blinn-Phong Reflectance Model

### Defining Per-Vertex Normal vectors
* Best to get vertex normals from the underlying geometry
* Other wise have to infer vertex normals from triangle faces
* Simple scheme: average surrounding face normals (Best to be weighted)

$$N_v = \frac{\sum_i\bold{N}_iS_i}{||\sum_i\bold{N}_iS_i||}$$

### Defining Per-Pixel Normal Vectors
**Barycentroc interpolation** of vertex normals, then normalize the vectors.

## Shader Programs
Describe operation on a single vertex (or fragment)

## Texture Mapping 
Surface Point(3D) -> Texture(2D)

Each triangle copies a piece of the texture image to the surface.

Each triangle vertex is assigned a texture coordinate$(u, v)$.
