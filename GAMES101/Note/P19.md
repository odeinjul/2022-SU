# Cameras, Lenses and Light Field
## Field of View
$$FOV = 2 \arctan(\frac{h}{2f})$$
Fix the 35mm lens focal length to get the field of view.
* 200mm $12^\circ$
* 50mm $47^\circ$
* 17mm $104^\circ$

Smaller sensor, shorter focal length, same fov.

## Exposure
$$H = T \times E$$
Exposure = time x irradiance

* Exposure time (T)
  * Controlled by shutter
* Irradiance (E)
  * Power of light falling on a unit area of sensor
  * Controlled by lens aperture and focal lenght

* Aperture size
  * Change f-stop / f-number: the smaller the f-number, the larger the aperture size. (1/N)
  * 
* Shutter speed
  *  Change the duration the sensor pixels integrate light
* ISO gain
  * Change the amplification (analog and/or digital) betweem semson values and digital image values.
  * Noise


Can achieve constant Exposure Time.
* Long-exposure photography;
* High-speed photography;

## Thin Lens Approximation
$$\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{z_i}+\frac{1}{z_o}$$
 
### Defocus Blur
**Computing Circle of Confusion Size**:
$$\frac{C}{A}=\frac{d'}{z_i}=\frac{|z_s-z_i|}{z_i}$$
**F-stop:**
$$N=\frac{f}{A}$$
$$C = A\frac{|z_s-z_i|}{z_i} = \frac{f}{N}\frac{|z_s-z_i|}{z_i}$$

### Ray Tracing for Defocus Blur
* For each pixel x' on the sensor
* Sample random points x'' on lens plae
* You know the ray passing through the lens will hit x'''(Use the lens equation)
* Estimate radiance on eay x''-x'''

### Depth of Field
depth range is where rhe corresponding CoC is considered small enough.
$$DOF = D_F - D_N$$

## Light Field / Lumigraph
* Plenoptic Function
  * $$P(\theta,\phi,\lambda,t,V_x,V_y,V_z)$$
* Ray
  * $$P(\theta,\phi,V_x,V_y,V_z)$$
* Ray on Plenoptic
  * $$P(V_x, V_y, \theta,, \phi)$$
