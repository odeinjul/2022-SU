# Geometry 3
## Actions:
* Mesh Subdivision (Upsampling)
* Mesh Simplification (Downsampling)
  * Preserve shape/appearance
* Mesh Regularization (same #triangles)

## Mesh Subdivision (Upsampling)
1. Create more triangles (vertices)
2. Tune their positions

**Loop Subdivision**:
* Split each triangle into 4
* Assign new vertex positions according to weights
  * New / Old vertices updated differently

For new vertices:
* $\texttt{New O = 3/8 * (A+B) + 1/8 * (C+D)}$

* A, B are old vertices on the same line of O.

* C, D are other 2 vertices in the 2 triangles.

For old vertices:
* $\texttt{New O = (1-n * u) * original\_position + u * neighbor\_position\_sum}$

* n: vertex degree
* u: 3/16 if n = 3, 3/8n otherwise

**Catmull-Clark Subdivision (General Mesh)**
* Non-quad face
* Extraordingary vertex (degree != 4)

Steps:
* Add (Central)vertex in each face
  * $f = \frac{v_1+v_2+v_3+v_4}{4}$
* Add midpoint on each edge
  * $e = \frac{v_1+v_2+f_1+f_2}{4}$
* Connect all the new vertices
* Modify old vertex point
  * $v = \frac{f_1+f_2+f_3+f_4+2(m_1+m_2+m_3+m_4)+4p}{16}$

Properties:
* Num of extraordinary vertices = Num of non-quad faces
* All non-quad faces dispear

## Mesh Simplification
### Quadric Error Metrics
**Quadric error:** new vertex should minimize its sum of square distance (L2 distance) to previously related triangle planes

**Idea：** Compute edge midpoint, measure quadric error, choose the minimized.

**Steps:**
* Compute quadric error
* Iteratively collapse edge with minimal quadric error and update related（Heap)
* greedy algorithm

## Shadows
### Shadow mapping
Draw shadows using rasterization, it's an image-space Algorithm.

**Key idea**: the points NOT in shadow must be seen both by the light and by the camera.

**Steps**:
1. Render from Light
   * Depth image from light source
2. Render from Eye
   * Standard image (with depth) from eye
3. Peoject tp light
   * project visible points in eye view back to light source
   * depth matches for light and eye (visible points)
   * depth from light and eye are not the same (blocked)

Compare distance(light, shading point) with shadow map.

* May cause aliasing due to floating point precision, and the resolution of the shadow map.
* Only hard shadows (point lights) are supported.
