# Shading 1 (Illumination, Shading and Graphics pipeline)
## Visibill / occlusion

### Z-buffering
Store min z-value for each pixel.
* Frame buffer - color values
* Color buffer - depth values
> Suppose z is always positive (smaller, closer)

If sample[x, y, z]'s z-value smaller than zbuffer[x, y], update framebuffer[x, y] and zbuffer[x, y]

Complexity: O(n)



## Shading - A simple shading model (Blinn-Phong Reflection Model)
Shading - Def: The process of applying a material to an object.

* Specular Highlight
* Diffuse Reflection
* Ambient lighting

Compute light reflected toward camera at a specific shading point:
* View direction, v
* Surface normal, n
* Light direction, l (for each of many lights)
* Surface parameters, color, shininess, etc.
> No Shadow will be generated! (Shading $\not ={}$ Shadow)

### Diffuse Reflection
Light is scattered uniformly, same color for all directions -> shading independent of view direction.

**How much the light is received?**
* Lambert's cosine law: light per unit area is proportional to $\cos \theta = l \cdot n$

### Light Falloff
Intensity of light is attenuated by distance.
$$I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$

### Lambertian (Diffuse) Shading
$$L_d = k_d (\frac{I}{r^2})max(0, \bold{n}\cdot\bold{l})$$
* $L_d$ diffusely received light
* $k_d$ diffuse coefficient (color), use vector to display RGB
* $max(0, \bold{n}\cdot\bold{l})$  energy received by the shading point
