## Curves (Bézier Curves)
> Defining curve with tangents

**Evaluating Bézier Curves - de Casteljau Algorithm**

Three points $b_0, b_1, b_2$ (quadratic Bézier)

Insert points using linear interpolation (at time $t$):
* $b_0^1 = (1-t)b_0 + tb_1$
* $b_1^1 = (1-t)b_1 + tb_2$
* $b_0^2 = (1-t)b_0^1 + tb_1^1$
  * $b_0^2 = (1-t)^2b_0 + 2t(1-t)b_1+t^2b_2$
* run the same algorithm for every t between 0 and 1
* connect all the final points

Four input of points $b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3$ (cubic Bézier)
Recursive the above steps.

**Evaluating Bézier Curves - Algebraic Formula**
"A pyramid of coefficients"
Use the following formula to evaluate the Bézier curve:
$$b^n(t) = b^n_0(t)=\sum^n_{j=0}b_jB_j^n(t)$$
Bernstein polynomials:
$$B_i^n(t) = {n\choose i}t^i(1-t)^{n-i}$$

**Properties of Bézier Curves**
* Interpolates endpoints: Cubic: $b(0)=b_0; b(1)=b_3$
* Tangent to end segments: Cubic: $b'(0)=3(b_1-b_0); b'(1) = 3(b_3 - b_2)$
* Affine transformation property
  * Affine after draw = draw the curve after affine points
  * Transform curve by transforming control points
* Convex hull property
  * Curve is within **convex hull** of control points
  * **convex hull**: The minimum area polygon that contains all the control points

**Piecewise Bézier Curves**

Chain many low-order Bézier curve instead of using high-order Bézier curve.

**Piecewise Cubic Bézier Curve!** (Four points)
The two joy sticks of the same point are
* Same length
* Collineation


**Piecewise Bézier Curves - Continuity**
* $C^0$ continuity $a_n = b_0$
* $C^1$ continuity $a_n = b_0 = \frac{1}{2}(a_{n-1}+b_1)$

**Bézier Curve is a kind of splines - a curve under contral**, B-splines is also a kind of splines.

## Surfaces (Bézier Surfaces)
* 4 x 4 points, for each row, generate a Bézier curve (4 curves).

* For each t, use 4 points on 4 curves to generate a new curve.

* As t increases, the moving curve will form a surface $(t_1, t_2) = (u,v)$.
