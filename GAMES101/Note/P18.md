# Advanced Topics in Rendering
* Unbiased 
  * The expected value of an unbiased estimator will always be the correct value.
* Biased
  * Special Case: the expected value converges to the correct value as infinite samples are used.
## Unbiased light transport methods
- Bidirectional path tracing
- Metropolis light transport
  - Markov Chain
  
## Biased light transport methods
- Photon mapping
  - Caustics / Specular-Diffuse-Specular
  - More photons, better. (infinite photons)
- Vertex connection and merging (VCM)

## Instant radiosity (VPL / many light methods)
Lit surfaces can be treatded as light sources.

# Advanced Appearance Modeling
## Non-surface models
- Participating media
- hair / fur / fiber (BCSDF)
  - Kajiya-Kay model 
  - Marschner model 
  - Double Cylinder Model
- Granular material
## Surface models
- Translucent material (BSSRDF)
  - Integrating over all points on the surface and all directions
- Cloth
  - A collection of twisted fibers!
- Detailed material (non-statistical BRDF)
## Procedural appearance
