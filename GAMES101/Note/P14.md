# Ray Tracing 2
## AABB
### Uniform Spatial Partitions (Grid)
1. Find bounding box
2. Create grid
3. Store each project in overlapping cells
Ray-Tracing
1. Step through grid in ray traversal order
2. for each grid cell
   * test intersection with each object in the cell

Heuristic
* #cells = C * #objs
* $C \approx27$ in 3D

### Spatial Partitions
* Oct-Tree
* BSP-Tree
* **KD-Tree**
  
Preprocessing:
Subdivide the box by using planes along x-,y-,z-axis

Store:
* Internal Nodes Store:
  * split axis
  * split position
  * children: pointers to child nodes
  * No objects are stored in internal nodes
* Leaf Nodes Store
  * list of objects

Traversing:
If intersect with a node, check its child nodes (or objects).
>An Object may be contained in multiple regions

### Object Partition & Bounding Volume Hierarchy
(overlapped bounding box)

**Steps:**
1. Finding a bounding box
2. Recursively split set of objects in two subsets
3. Recompute the bounding box of the subsets
4. Stop when necessary
5. Store objects in each leaf code

**How to split a node?**
* Choose a dimension to split
* Always choose the longest axis in node 
* Split node at location of **median (num)** object
  * ï¼ˆtop k problem / Quickselect)
  * Balance Tree? (AVL?)
* Stop when node contains few elements

Store:
* Internal Nodes Store:
  * Bounding box
  * children: pointers to child nodes
* Leaf Nodes Store
  * Bounding box
  * list of objects
* Node represent subset of primitive in scene
  * All objects in subtree

> Bounding box may overlap in space

## Basic  

**Radiant Energy:**
$$Q[J=Joule]$$
**Radiant Flux(Power):** energy per unit times / #photons flowing through a sensor per unit time
$$\Phi = \frac{dQ}{dt}[W=Watt][lm=lumen]^*$$

### Light Measurement
* Light emit from a source = Radiant Intensity
* Light falling on a surface = Irradiance
* Light traveling along a ray
#### Radiant Intensity
**Power per unit solid angle** emitted by a point light source:
$$I(\omega)=\frac{d\Phi}{d\omega}$$
$$\left[\frac{W}{sr}\right]=\left[\frac{lm}{sr}\right]=cd=candela$$

**Solid angle**:
$$\theta = \frac{l}{r}$$
Circle has $2\pi$ radians.
$$\Omega = \frac{A}{r^2}$$
Sphere has $4\pi$ steradians.
**Differential solid angles**
$$dA = r^2\sin\theta d\theta d\phi$$
$$d\omega = \sin\theta d\theta d\phi$$
We can use $\vec{\omega}$ as a direction vector.
$$I \equiv \frac{\Phi}{4\pi}$$
