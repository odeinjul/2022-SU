## Antialiasing
### Sampling Theory
**Alias**: Two frequencies that are indistinguishable at a given sampling rate.

**Aliasing Artifacts**: Signals are changing so fast (high frequency) but sampled slowly.

**Antialiasing Idea**: Blurring (pre-filtering before sampling)

Higher frequencies need faster sampling.

**Filtering**: Getting rid of certain frequency contents.


Option 1:
* Filter by convolution in the spatial domain.
  

**Convolution in spatial domain = multiply in frequency domain**

Option 2:
* Spatial domain -> (fourier transform) -> frequency domain
* Multiply by fourier transform of convolution kernel.
* (inverse fourier transform) -> spatial domain 

**High-pass filter**: edges

**Low-pass filter**: blurring

Filtering = convolution = averaging
