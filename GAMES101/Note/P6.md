## Antialiasing
### Sampling Theory
**Alias**: Two frequencies that are indistinguishable at a given sampling rate.

**Aliasing Artifacts**: Signals are changing so fast (high frequency) but sampled slowly.

**Antialiasing Idea**: Blurring (pre-filtering before sampling)

Higher frequencies need faster sampling.

### Filtering 
Getting rid of certain frequency contents.

Option 1:
* Filter by convolution in the spatial domain.
  

**Convolution in spatial domain = multiply in frequency domain**

Option 2:
* Spatial domain -> (fourier transform) -> frequency domain
* Multiply by fourier transform of convolution kernel.
* (inverse fourier transform) -> spatial domain 

**High-pass filter**: edges

**Low-pass filter**: blurring

Filtering = convolution = averaging

**Box filter** (Normalization!)

$$Box = \frac{1}{9}
\left[\begin{matrix}
1 & 1 &1 \\
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1  

\end{matrix} \right]
$$


Box Function = Low-pass filter

Wilder Filter Kernel = Lower Frequency = Blurring

Sampling = Repeating Frequency Contents

Aliasing = Mixed Frequency Contents

**Reduce Aliasing Error**:
* Incresing sampling rate
* Antialiasing
  * Making fourier contents "narrower" before repeating
  * i.e. filtering out high frequencies before sampling 

**A 1 pixel-width box filter**:
* Convolve f(x, y) by 1-pixel-width box filter
  * convolving = filtering = averaging
* Then sample at every pixel's center

### Antialiasing by supersampling (MSAA)
Approximate the effect of the 1-pixel box filter by sampling multiple locations within a pixel and average their values

**Disadvantage**: increase computation

**Milestones**: FXAA, TAA

**Superresolution**:
* From low resolution to high resolution
* Essentially still not enough samples problem
* DLSS
