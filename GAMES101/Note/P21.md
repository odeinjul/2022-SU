# Animation
## Methods:
* Keyframe Animation
  * Interpolation
* Physics Simulation
## Mass Spring System
* Spring
$$f=k\cdot\Delta x$$
* Damping Force
$$f= -k_d (\dot b-\dot a)$$

### Structures
* Sheets
  * Steep connection
    * Resist shearing
      * Less directional bias
    * Resist out-of-plane bending
      * Red springs should be much weaker
* Blocks
* Others

Instead: Finite Element Method

## Particle System
Need:
* Many particles
* Acceleration structures (find the nearest neighbor)

Method:
* Create
* Caculate
* Update (position, velocity, acceleration)
* Remove (If need)
* Render 

Force:
* Attraction / Repulsion
* Damping forces
* Collisions

## Forward Kinematics
Skeleton:
* Topology
* Geographic
* Tree structure

Joint types:
* Pin
* Ball
* Prismatic joint

## Inverse Kinematics
Terminal -> joints' position
* Multi solution
* No solution

Solution: gradient descent.

## Rigging

## Blend Shapes

## Motion Capture
